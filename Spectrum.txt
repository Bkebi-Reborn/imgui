## Controls
* Button - matches Spectrum's Action button. Other buttons to be added (call to action, primary).
* Checkbox - ok
* Radio - ok
* Combo - not adapted. Need work on Selectables and overall look.
* Input - more or less ok
* Drag and slider controls do not match Spectrum, but would be a pain to do since each is coded individually (int, float, etc). 
* Scrollbar - colors ok, Spectrum's bar is smaller when not active.
* Resize control - Spectrum doesn't have one (?), matches scrollbar colors.
* Collapsing Header - Spectrum doesn't have this, but it is a common feature of ImGui. Implemented, inspired by Spectrum's Call-To-Action button. 


## Internal Changes
* Added spectrum.h with spectrum colors under `namespace Spectrum`.
* Added RenderFrameBorder that takes border color and size
* Added color parameter to RenderText, RenderTextWrapped, RenderTextClipped
